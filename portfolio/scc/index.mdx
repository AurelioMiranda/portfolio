statement_1: "This project was purely academic which revolved around the ideal of transforming a locally deployed application into a 
cloud based solution."
statement_2: "To do this, Azure was used in the first iteration (with Cosmos DB, Blob storage, Redis Cache, etc) while the second 
iteration was deployed using Docker and Kubernetes. Both solutions where tested with Postman and Artillery tests to document response time, 
load balancing and many other stats."
