This application offers a comprehensive management system designed primarily for companies engaged in nautical activities. 
Alongside the main website, which facilitates equipment, employee, and activity management, NautiGo provides a mobile application 
that enables real-time user tracking. This functionality allows website moderators to monitor clients using the equipment effectively.

Previously, NautiGo was accessible at the domain https://nautigo.azurewebsites.net/. However, the team has decided not to proceed 
with further updates beyond the initial launch, and thus the application is no longer available at that domain.
