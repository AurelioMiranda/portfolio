statement_1: "Creative AI was an international project from the I Living Labs that had the objective of developing a piece of art using 
entirely AI. Our team decided to make a video showcasing the usefulness of AI to build and manipulate 3D models."
statement_2: "The core objective of the video was to make it seem like the character was lucid dreaming through the Fine Art Gallery
in Traismauer and for that, models of the various rooms where made using LumaAI and then rendered in Unreal Engine 5. 
The final result is to be published soon."
