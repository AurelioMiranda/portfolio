statement_1: "Logistical Network was an academic project aimed to replicate a GPS in a closed network, in this case we have 3 main countries, 
one with 32 cities and 2 with 128. The end goal of this application was to find the most efficient path between two cities and also provide
additional metrics and options."
statement_2: "This application was merely academic and, although it was a complete success in every single way, there are more 
advanced options already in the market."
